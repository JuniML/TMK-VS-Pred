You will find herein the code and files related to our paper:

**Muhammad Junaid, Bo Wang, and Wenjin Li. "Data-augmented machine learning scoring functions for virtual screening of YTHDF1 m6A reader protein." *Computers in Biology and Medicine* 183 (2024): 109268.**

The example directory contains Jupyter Notebook which the users can use to predict the class for their molecules against YTHDF1

To run the notebook, users have to install the libraries using the requirments.yml file and should activate the environment

```
conda env create -f requirments.yml
conda activate TMK-VS-Pred
```

The protocol-env environment has to be set up before the notebooks are used: please find the protocol-env.yml file for this purpose in our MLSF-protocol GitHub repository: https://github.com/vktrannguyen/MLSF-protocol.
